# firebase-crud
CRUD operation using Firebase's Python APIs

For getting started create a firebase project and download the service account private key and place it inside the cred folder, and rename the file to 'cred.json'

Follow this amazing yet annoying documentation from google: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore

Note: Will update the readme after sometime
